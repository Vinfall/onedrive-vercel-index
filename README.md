## Notice

This is forked from the now archived [spencerwooo/onedrive-vercel-index](https://github.com/spencerwooo/onedrive-vercel-index),
please refer to the original repo if you wanna self-host it.

Contribution is highly appreciated as I have no prior experience with NextJS. For the moment the only thing I can do is utilizing dependabot to update dependencies and expect them to work flawlessly. Be sure to check [pinned issue](https://github.com/Vinfall/onedrive-vercel-index/issues/122) if you are interested!

Yes! Completely free with no backend server what-so-ever. (Well, we use Redis, but that's free to some extent also.)
